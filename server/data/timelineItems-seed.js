It is further claimed that Auction.co.kr delayed 20 hours after the attack before comfirming the loss of information. Korean users rebuked the website for being too slow to act. It was confirmed that the attack was launched through China’s internet.  Auction.co.kr also confirmed that after the incident, they received a phone call offering to exchange the user information for money.                                                                                                                                          The Chinese hacker did not directly attack the server, instead s/he took a roundabout strategy. The hacker sent out bulk e-mailings to the auction staff containing “hacker procedures” (I’m guessing this means with Trojans attached). When the staff members confirmed the e-mails, the hacker was able to gain their IDs. The hacker was then able to login to the Auction server using the staffer’s ID.",

In 2011, Ackroyd was part of the small groups of hackers who breached the security of HBGaryFederal.com through an SQL injection and is said to have social engineered the administrator of rootkit.com, HBGary's CEO's personal website to gain root access to their entire systems. During the rise of the groups \"LulzSec\", Ackroyd is said to be its most talented hacker, doing much of the security penetration along with Hector Monsegur. He hacked into fox.com, UK Bank Machines, Sony, PBS, the FBI, Bethesda Softworks, Senate.gov, Arizona Department of Public Safety, AT&T, AOL, Navy.mil, Infragard Atlanta, NATO Bookshops and others during LulzSec's infamous \"50 Days of Lulz\".Ackroyd is responsible for the hack on Booz Allen, where Edward Snowden was an employee.

Tflow also managed the LulzSecurity.com website during its short run in June 2011. Tflow's integral role in the operation which hacked the servers of HBGaryFederal, defaced its homepage and leaked more than 70,000 private company emails, doing millions of dollars worth of damage. During the next several months, Tflow and fellow hacktivists Topiary, Sabu, Kayla, Pwnsauce and Palladium began searching for vulnerabilities in high level computer systems. During this time, Tflow and Topiary are credited with inventing the name \"LulzSec\" for the hacking groups they were forming",

In retaliation for Aaron Barr's claims, members of the groups Anonymous hacked the website of HBGary Federal and replaced the welcome page with a message stating that Anonymous should not be messed with, and that the hacking of the website was necessary to defend itself. Using a variety of techniques, including social engineering and SQL injection, Anonymous also went on to take control of the company's e-mail, dumping 70,000 e-mails from the system, erasing files, and taking down their phone system.",

He later turned informant for the FBI, working with the agency for over ten months to aid them in identifying other hackers from LulzSec and related groups. LulzSec intervened in the affairs of organizations such as News Corporation, Stratfor, UK and American law enforcement bodies and Irish political party Fine Gael. Federal agents arrested Monsegur on June 7, 2011. The following day, Monsegur agreed to become an informant for the FBI and to continue his \"Sabu\" persona. As a groups founder, he acted as a kind of leader. Sabu would often decide what targets to attack next and who could participate in these attacks. Sabu was arrested in June 2011 and identified as a 29-year-old unemployed man from New York’s Lower East Side. On 15 August, he pleaded guilty to several hacking charges and agreed to cooperate with the FBI. Over the following seven months he successfully unmasked the other members of the groups. Sabu was identified by Backtrace Security as Hector Montsegur on 11 March 2011 in a PDF publication named \"Namshub.\"",

They have also claimed responsibility for the defacing of government websites in countries such as Zimbabwe, Syria, Tunisia, Ireland, and Egypt. Topiary was also a suspected former member of the Anonymous, where he used to perform media relations, including hacking the website of the Westboro Baptist Church during a live interview. Topiary ran the LulzSec Twitter account on a daily basis; following the announcement of LulzSec's dissolution, he deleted all the posts on his Twitter page, except for one, which stated: \"You cannot arrest an idea\". Police arrested a man from Shetland, United Kingdom suspected of being Topiary on 27 July 2011. The man was later identified as Jake Davis and was charged with five counts, including unauthorized access of a computer and conspiracy. He was indicted on conspiracy charges on 6 March 2012.",

But what I hope to do is leave you a bit intrigue about the individual or as Steve Wozniak aptly described [Steve] \"has lived a life as exciting and gripping as the best capper movies.\"\n\n Kevin Mitnick is an individual who's actions heavily shaped terms we use to describe methods of intrusion such as \"hacking\" and \"social engineerin\" during his exploits in the 70's and 80's before these terms were even known or there was even computer laws on the books.  Through his numerous hacking escapades against phone companies, mobile phone manufactures and OS vendors early in his career, or instructional books, training and speeches as a reformed black-hat hacker,  Kevin has provided corporations and everyday developers alike with a wealth of information to help be better prepared.",
